# Go Localised Observation Calculator

In order to observe celestial phenomena, one must be able to find it in the
inky void.

GLOC aims to figure this out for you, wherever you may be on earth. All you
need to do is input your longitude and latitude as well as the celestial
coordinates (right ascension and declination) and it will give you the azimuth
and altitude at which your object may be viewed from your location.

## Features

There are a lot of features planned, but we will see how far we can get.

Planned features include:

* [ ] Checking if a given object is visible
* [ ] Converting right ascension and declination into azimuth and altitude
* [ ] Calculation of visible celestial hemisphere for location
* [ ] Calibration of calculations from observations using a Kalman Filter
* [ ] Generation of sighting tables (per hour) for celestial phenomena
* [ ] Tracking of non-stationary celestial objects such as satellites and planets
* [ ] Reporting of uncertainty margins in calculations

Ultimately, this should be a quick and dirty reference for locating and
sighting celestial bodies in the night sky from the observers point on Earth.
The idea is to build it out roughly and improve accuracy as iterations go on.
